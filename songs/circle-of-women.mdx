## Lyrics 

And may all mothers know that they are loved  
And may all sisters know that they are strong  
And may all daughters know that they are **worthy**
1. |: That the circle of women may live on :|  
2. |: That the fire of the Goddess may burn on :|   
  
Wehaheya wehaheya wehahey wehaheya  
  
And may all mothers know that they are loved  
And may all sisters know that they are strong  
And may all daughters know that they are **beautiful**
1. |: That the circle of women may live on :|  
2. |: That the fire of the Goddess may burn on :|   
  
Wehaheya wehaheya wehahey wehaheya  
  
And may all mothers know that they are loved  
And may all sisters know that they are strong  
And may all daughters know that they are **powerful**  
1. |: That the circle of women may live on :|  
2. |: That the fire of the Goddess may burn on :|   
  
Wehaheya wehaheya wehahey wehaheya
