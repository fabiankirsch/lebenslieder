## Lyrics 

  
The river is flowing.  
Flowing and growing.  
The river is flowing back to the sea.  
  
Mother earth carry me  
The child I will always be.  
Mother earth carry me  
Back to the sea. (6x)  
  
carry me   
carry me  
back to the sea  
back to the sea  
  
carry me   
carry me   
carry me   
back to the sea  
back to the sea  
back to the sea
